# alphaOS
A operating system for Minecraft mod OpenComputers 

This operating system will support window interface once I have the time to write one
Right now there is nothing, I will need to add the basic stuff for booting
Like the main library's the most important is "io.lua" so I can operate everything 
Then I can add the others I need. I need to do some research for this

Right now I'm working on "io.lua"
Then I will start working on:
"stream.lua"
"buffer.lua"
"cursor.lua"
maybe "thread.lua"
"keyboard.lua"
"term.lua"
"gui.lua"
"window.lua"

Here's the wiki that I made for this (mostly likely not working) https://github.com/AlphaTechNinja/alphaOS.wiki.git
