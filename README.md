# alphaOS
A operating system for Minecraft mod OpenComputers 

This operating system will support window interface once I have the time to write one
Right now there is nothing, I will need to add the basic stuff for booting
Like the main library's the most important is "component.lua" so I can operate everything 
Then I can add the others I need. I need to do some research for this
